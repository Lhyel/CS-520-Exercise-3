```python
# Specifications for change_base(x: int, base: int)

# The return value 'res' must be a string.
assert isinstance(res, str)

# Each character in 'res' must be a digit from 0 to base - 1.
assert all(c.isdigit() and 0 <= int(c) < base for c in res)

# The numerical value of 'res' in base 'base' must equal 'x'.
assert int(res, base) == x
```

```python
# assert n >= 0 # 'n' should be a non-negative integer
# assert type(n) == int # 'n' should be of the integer data type
# assert res >= 0 # The result should be a non-negative integer
# assert type(res) == int # The result should be an integer
